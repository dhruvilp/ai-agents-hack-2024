Financial institutions in the financial services sector face challenges in complying with evolving AI regulations that mandate transparency, accountability, and data privacy. They are required to implement robust governance frameworks to document AI decision-making processes, conduct regular audits, and ensure the ethical use of AI in high-stakes areas like AML and BSA compliance. Institutions must also adapt to changing regulatory requirements, provide clear explanations of AI model decisions, safeguard against biases, and maintain data privacy. https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/banking-trends-strategies/genai-bankings-best-offense-in-challenging-times-174940/ The proposed solution addresses the compliance challenges by automating key aspects of regulatory monitoring. By using Whisper to transcribe relevant communications, Granite LLM Model to analyze data, and MoA to delegate and automate tasks, the solution ensures efficient tracking of regulatory changes and internal policies. Langchain manages the workflow to maintain timely compliance, while Crew AI coordinates between agents and human officers, enhancing overall adherence to regulations and streamlining the compliance process.
