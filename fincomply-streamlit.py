            "description": "FinCEN Issues Supplemental Alert on Israeli Extremist Violence in the West Bank",
            "alert_message": "Supplemental Alert: FinCEN Highlights Additional Red Flags Regarding Financing of Israeli Extremist Settler Violence Against Palestinians in the West Bank As noted in the February 2024 Alert, the United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including attacks by Israeli violent extremist settlers against Palestinians, attacks by Palestinian violent extremists against Israelis, and other acts that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities and risk further escalating tensions and expanding the conflict in the region.3 Treasury continues to be concerned by reports of escalating violence in the West Bank,4 including reported attacks by Israeli settlers on humanitarian aid convoys,5 and encourages continued reporting by financial institutions of suspicious activity potentially related to the financing of these violent acts. Since publication of the February 2024 Alert, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of State have collectively designated 13 individuals and entities6 under Executive Order (E.O.) 14115, which authorizes the U.S. government to impose financial sanctions on foreign persons that, inter alia, are responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in (1) actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or (2) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in specified actions affecting the West Bank, such as violence targeting civilians and property destruction.7 OFAC reminds individuals and financial institutions that all U.S. persons, which generally include any person in the United States, any entity organized under U.S. law, and any U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident anywhere in the world, are generally prohibited from making any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any individual or entity designated under E.O. 14115 and any entities owned 50 percent or more by such designated individuals or entities.8 This includes engaging in crowdfunding activities that are used to raise funds internationally in support of designated violent extremist Israeli settlers, as well as other fundraising undertaken on behalf of such designated persons.9 Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions, such as prohibitions on causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions. Violations of U.S. sanctions may result in civil or criminal penalties,10 and persons who materially support any person blocked pursuant to E.O. 14115 may themselves be sanctioned. FinCEN is providing additional red flag indicators of suspicious activity potentially related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including flags derived from open-source reporting. All red flag indicators highlighted in the February 2024 Alert remain valid,11 and FinCEN has identified the following additional red flag indicators to help financial institutions detect, prevent, and report potential suspicious activity related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank: Payments involving entities, individuals, addresses on accounts, receiving addresses, or IP addresses linked to any West Bank “outpost.”12 References or payments to accounts held in the name of Israeli violent extremist settler groups or individuals involved or implicated in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including references or payments to accounts held by known immediate family members of designated individuals. The West Bank region may also be referred to as “Judea and Samaria,” “Shomron,” “Yehuda,” or “Yehuda v’Shomoron” by supporters of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.13 References or payments to accounts or webpages that are fundraising for convicted, imprisoned, or U.S.-sanctioned violent extremists who targeted Palestinians in the West Bank. Accounts that share a merchant representative, email, phone number, social media page, or physical address with accounts held in the name of designated individuals or entities. Payments to beneficiaries, accounts, or crowdfunding campaigns linked to social media indicating support for violence in the West Bank, including pictures and videos, support for violence targeting Palestinians in the West Bank, or references to known or designated Israeli settler violent extremists, outposts, herding farms, or groups. Crowdfunding campaigns and social media may include phrases like “State Land,” “Area C,” “preserving State Land,” “Hilltop Youth,” “Youth of the Hills,” or “stopping supply convoys.” FinCEN reminds financial institutions that, as no single red flag is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances before determining whether a specific transaction is suspicious or associated with potential Israeli extremist settler violence."

This alert provides select red flags to assist financial institutions in identifying and reporting suspicious activity that finances such violence. The United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including attacks by Israeli violent extremist settlers against Palestinians, attacks by Palestinian violent extremists against Israelis, and other acts that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities and risk further escalating tensions and expanding the conflict in the region.2 As the U.S. Department of State (State) noted, the U.S. Government “will continue to seek accountability and justice for all acts of violence against civilians in the West Bank, regardless of the perpetrator or the victim.”3 Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) additionally is highlighting for members of the public that the President, on February 1, 2024, issued an Executive Order (E.O.) that authorizes the U.S. government to impose sanctions on foreign persons that are responsible for or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in (1) actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or (2) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in specified actions affecting the West Bank, such as violence targeting civilians and property destruction.4 The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those engaged in such activities, as well as to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse FinCEN has identified the following red flag indicators to help detect, prevent, and report potential suspicious activity related to the financing of Israeli extremist settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. As no single red flag is necessarily indicative of illicit or suspicious activity, financial institutions should consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances before determining whether a specific transaction is suspicious or associated with potential Israeli extremist settler violence: Payments to any organizations or groups, including nonprofit organizations (NPO),5 that are now or have been previously linked to violent extremist groups in the West Bank or lists an officer, founder, or director that is currently or has been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank. Information included in a transaction between customers, such as references in the memo field, that indicate support for Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Transactions with no apparent economic, business, or lawful purpose associated with a rapid movement of funds and linked to NPOs active in supporting violent extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank, particularly if the NPO has advocated for, or solicited donations on social media in support of, Israeli violent extremist groups or campaigns. Purchases of tactical military gear for resale overseas and destined for non-government Israeli end-users in the West Bank, particularly if the end-users are currently or have been previously linked to Israeli violent extremist groups in the West Bank. FinCEN requests that financial institutions reference this alert by including the key term “FIN-2024- WBEXTREMISM” in SAR field 2 (Filing Institutions Note to FinCEN) and the narrative to indicate a connection between the suspicious activity being reported and this alert."

Financial institutions are advised to scrutinize trade transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions and industries known for TBML practices.

Iran seeks, among other goals, to project power by exporting terrorism throughout the Middle East and beyond through the financing of a range of regional armed groups, some of which are U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated Global Terrorist organizations (SDGTs).2 These terrorist organizations include Lebanese Hizballah (Hizballah),3 Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ),5 the Houthis (Ansarallah),6 and several Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq and Syria. As demonstrated by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea,7 these organizations are capable of perpetrating horrific violence, causing destruction, and disrupting critical supply chains. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has been systematically working to dismantle these organizations by disrupting their illicit finance networks and eliminating their sources of revenue.8 This advisory highlights the means by which terrorist organizations receive support from Iran and describes several typologies these terrorist organizations use to illicitly access or circumvent the international financial system to raise, move, and spend funds. It also provides red flags that may assist financial institutions in identifying related suspicious activity and is consistent with FinCEN’s National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/ CFT) Priorities, which include terrorist financing.9 The information contained in this advisory is derived from FinCEN’s analysis of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) data, open-source reporting, and information provided by law enforcement partners. Iran’s Sources of Foreign Revenue Iran uses the revenue from the sale of commodities, particularly oil, to countries such as the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to fund its terrorist proxies.13 Following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum sector in 2018,14 Iran’s ability to finance itself through sales of crude oil and petroleum products—its most important economic sector—was severely diminished. In response, Iran established large-scale global oil smuggling and money laundering networks to enable access to foreign currency and the international financial system through the illicit sale of crude oil and petroleum products in global markets.15 In 2021, the National Iranian Oil Company sold approximately $40 billion worth of products,16 and its crude oil and condensate exports reached an average of more than 600,000 barrels per day, with nearly all of it sent to the PRC and Syria.17 Iran’s exports to the PRC have increased over time, reaching approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.18 Some of these oil proceeds finance the activities of the IRGC-QF and other terrorist groups.19 To restrict these sources of revenue, Treasury has designated numerous Iranian- and third-country operatives, front companies, and ships involved in Iran’s oil smuggling networks."
